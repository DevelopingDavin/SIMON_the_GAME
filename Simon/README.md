#  Simon Game



GAME DESCRIPTION: 
(taken from actual Hasbro site)

    *players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order.*



PURPOSE OF REPO:
- Personal challange to grow my coding skills. 


PLAN:
- Modeled after the famous Hasboro Game. 
- Follow MVVM Architecture
- NOT FOR SALE OR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN KNOWLEDGE BUILDING!
- Build in phases (based on ability)






Phase 1:

- GameUI (ContentView)

- ButtonViews (Group Folder)
    + Red Button (Individual View)
    + Yellow Button (Individual View)
    + Blue Button (Individual View)
    + Green Button (Individual View)
    
- StartGameButton
    + Start Game Button (Individual View)
    + On Action:
        1. Create pattern for flashing buttons. (ViewModel)
        2. Push View to make buttons "flash" based on generated pattern. (ViewModel)
        
        
Phase 2:        
        
- Create ViewModels to make Phase 1 functional. 
        
Need to learn:

    - Generate a random pattern & pushing the button views to flash accordingly. 
    
    - Break down "flashes" to individual actions that require correct user mimicking before continuing the pattern. 
    

Phase 3:

TBD...
